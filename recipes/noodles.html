    <p>Buttered noodles are simple to make with your favorite pasta, butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper for a quick and easy, kid-friendly dish. Fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. Perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</p>

    <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
    <ul>

       <li> 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>

       <li> 3 (8 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        
       <li> ½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        
      <li>  4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        
       <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
        
       <li> ½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        
      <li>  ½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        
       <li> ¾ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        
       <li> ⅔ cup rolled oats</li>
        
       <li> ½ cup freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        
       <li> 2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>

<h1>STEPS</h1>
<ol>
<li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, salt, pepper, and oregano; cook and stir until mushrooms have released their juices and the liquid has evaporated, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat.</li>

<li>Transfer mushrooms to a cutting board and clean the skillet.</li>

<li>Chop mushrooms into small chunks, then transfer to a large bowl. Mix in bread crumbs and oats, and season with salt and pepper as needed. Stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, then eggs; let stand until bread crumbs have absorbed any excess liquid, about 15 minutes. Use moist hands to form mixture, 1/4 cup at a time, into patties.</li>

<li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry patties in the hot skillet until golden brown and cooked through, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
